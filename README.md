# Schnoodle
Schnoodle is a progressive DeFi dog-themed meme token with multisig and DAO governance. The first of its kind.

# Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)
- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows) 7 or later
- Local blockchain (use [Truffle Develop](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/using-truffle-develop-and-the-console#truffle-develop) or [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache))

The following shared services should be set up **only once** per blockchain (except local):
1. Gnosis Safe
    - Create Safe on [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app) (mainnet) or equivalent testnet (e.g., [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io/app)).
    - Update `governance.proposers` and `governance.executors` in `migrations-config.[chain].js` with Safe address (tutorial [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/tutorial-on-using-a-gnosis-safe-multisig-with-a-timelock-to-upgrade-contracts-and-use-functions-in-a-proxy-contract/7272) if required).
1. Snapshot / SafeSnap
    - Create a Snapshot space [here](https://snapshot.org/#/setup) using [this guide](https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/create).
    - Deploy and enable a SafeSnap DAO module instance with a default template as per the 'Setting up the module' instructions [here](https://github.com/gnosis/dao-module/blob/main/docs/setup_guide.md#setting-up-the-module).
    - Integrate the DAO module instance into Snapshot by adding the SafeSnap plugin to [Snapshot space settings](https://snapshot.org/#/schnoodle.eth/settings) with config `{ "address": "<DAO module address>" }`.

# Setup
1. Execute `npm i`.
1. In Visual Studio Code, open each Solidity file in the [contracts](contracts) folder corresponding to the ABI files listed in [Nethereum.Generator.json](SchnoodleDApp/Nethereum.Generator.json), and press F5 ('Solidity: Compile Contract' command).
1. If target network is local, execute `truffle develop` in a separate terminal.
1. Execute `.\Migrate.ps1 <network> $true $true` where `<network>` is the target network per the `networks` property in [truffle-config.js](truffle-config.js).

# Blockchain Launch
1. Note the 'To' contract address of the `create_0_1` internal transaction of the `SchnoodleTimelockFactory` Contract Creation transaction. Verify the `SchnoodleTimelock` contract using this address.
1. Add liquidity to Uniswap V2, and note the liquidity token address (UNI-V2 token) from the corresponding transaction.
1. [Create a timelock contract](#create-timelock-contract) to lock the full amount of the liquidity token held by the beneficiary wallet.

# Operational Procedures
## Timelock Tokens
Follow these steps to timelock tokens:
1. Call `create` on `SchnoodleTimelockFactory` specifying the contract address of the token to be locked, the beneficiary, and the release time as a [Unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com).
1. Once the transaction has been mined, note the 'To' contract address of the `create_0` internal transaction. Verify that this is the `SchnoodleTimelock` clone address.
1. Transfer the desired amount of tokens to be locked from the token contract address to the `SchnoodleTimelock` clone address.
1. After timelock elapsed, go to `SchnoodleTimelock` clone address, and call `release`.

## Configuration
1. Perform a [contract interaction](#contract-interaction) with `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` to call a function (e.g., `changeFeePercent`, `changeEleemosynary`, `maintenance`, `configure`).

## Contract Upgrade
1. Execute `.\Migrate.ps1 <network>` where `<network>` is the target network per the `networks` property in [truffle-config.js](truffle-config.js).
1. Perform a [contract interaction](#contract-interaction) with `ProxyAdmin` to call `upgrade` using `proxy` and `implementation` parameters outputted in step 1.

## Contract Interaction
Contract interaction is via either 1) multisig (SafeSnap optional) if `SchnoodleGovernance` is the contract owner, or 2) SafeSnap (DAO) directly if the Gnosis Safe address is the contract owner. The contract owner may be set during deployment or by calling `transferOwnership` on the contract. A multisig contract can be made into a DAO contract by following the [multisig](#multisig) process using the `transferOwnership` function.

### Multisig
1. Go to the contract address to be interacted with and call the desired function.
1. Copy the HEX DATA from MetaMask and reject the transaction.
1. Follow steps 27 and 28 from [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/tutorial-on-using-a-gnosis-safe-multisig-with-a-timelock-to-upgrade-contracts-and-use-functions-in-a-proxy-contract/7272).
1. Follow steps 29 and 30 from [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/tutorial-on-using-a-gnosis-safe-multisig-with-a-timelock-to-upgrade-contracts-and-use-functions-in-a-proxy-contract/7272) per either of the following scenarios:
    * **Multisig only:** After timelock elapsed.
    * **DAO:** Interact with `SchnoodleGovernance` via the [SafeSnap](#safesnap) process instead of directly.

### SafeSnap
1. Go to [Snapshot space settings](https://snapshot.org/#/schnoodle.eth/settings) and ensure `address` in strategy is the `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` contract address.
1. Go to [Snapshot space new proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/schnoodle.eth/create) and add a 'Contract Interaction' transaction:
    * `to` is the contract address to be interacted with.
    * `function` is the function to be called.
    * Set the parameters as required.
1. After voting is closed, anyone may trigger the following actions on the plugin:
    * Request execution to put the question on [reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/app/) for 24 hours.
    * Set the outcome with a bond (in ETH). The outcome should resolve in accordance with the vote in (game) theory.
    * After the question outcome is finalised and it is in favour, the upgrade transaction may be triggered by anyone to be executed on the interaction contract.
1. If the proposal is malicious, it may be vetoed during the 24-hour cooldown period via Gnosis Safe by calling `markProposalInvalid` on the DAO module contract address.
    * The `proposalId` and `txHashes` values may be found from the `Input Data` of the relevant `Add Proposal` transaction on the DAO module contract.

# FAQ
### On Ubuntu, I get the the error `Error: not found: make`.
Refer to [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14772631/197591).

### On Linux, I get the 'make' error `No such file or directory`.
If your clone path has spaces, this is due to a known [bug](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?712). Avoid spaces in your clone path.
