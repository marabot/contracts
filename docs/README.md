# üê∂ Introduction

## Headline

Schnoodle is a true trustless and progressive DeFi DAO that bridges key cryptocurrency concepts including meme, yield farming, NFTs, and multichain interoperability.

Our goal is to help other DAO projects utilise our innovative technology, and grow our DAO platforms through our SaaS systems.

## Our Story

> "What's past is prologue." ‚îÄ William Shakespeare. _The Tempest._

Schnoodle ƒêAO's story began when our founder, Jason Payne, also known within the community as Neo, realised that decentralised finance is the key to unlocking sustainable economies and enabling communities to grow and prosper together. However, Jason discovered a problem. The DeFi projects and DAOs on the market are not truly decentralised, and this needed to change.

At the time of launch in the summer of 2021, meme tokens were becoming increasingly popular, with some reaching incredible new heights never seen before in the world of crypto.

That‚Äôs when Jason came up with the idea of creating the world‚Äôs first truly decentralised, autonomous organisation using a meme backdrop to bootstrap initial adoption. After innovating the bleeding edge technology that created the foundations of our DAO today, Schnoodle Finance and our mascot Krypto were born!

Since the innovation started, it hasn‚Äôt stopped. With the release of update after update, our Moon Farming Platform and other disruptive technologies, Schnoodle quickly became the most advanced DAO project in existence.

Although it was great to be the only true DAO on the market, the Schnoodle core team soon realised that it's much more valuable to use our groundbreaking technology to help other DAOs reach their full potential.

This was when a new chapter began, and Schnoodle Finance was rebranded to what we're known as today, Schnoodle ƒêAO. Being a meme token was never our true destiny, but it's a part of our story and is something that will always be remembered.

## Mission

Schnoodle ƒêAO is devoted to providing truly decentralised platforms for our community to interact with while helping other projects unlock their decentralised potential through our SaaS (Software as a Service) system.

Ultimately, we want to expand the scope of truly decentralised technology and work towards a more decentralised world where communities can work together and reach new heights.

We believe that decentralising organisations will increase innovation and creativity, allowing members to communicate effectively while working remotely. We aim to set an example of how fair working within a DAO can be, and showcase how powerful it can be to others worldwide.

## Philosophy

Schnoodle's overarching philosophy in everything it does is to always be truly trustless decentralised cryptocurrency. We believe that trustlessness is a parity between the trustless and the trusted. This means that Schnoodle is completely community-driven, but with a founding team guiding the community with a vision to achieve the goals of Schnoodle. In essence, this means there is no requirement for holders to rely on the team to fulfil promises to do as the community desires. The ecosystem of smart contracts ensures that the unopinionated nature of the code provides the community with absolute confidence in the viability and future of Schnoodle.

The advanced technologies behind Schnoodle ensure that software upgrade proposals created and voted for by the community are fully automated using gasless (zero cost) off-chain voting mechanisms, and then executed on-chain via an escalation-game-based blockchain oracle. This decentralised process epitomises the very nature of blockchain, something no blockchain project has ever truly achieved.

We believe we are the first blockchain project to achieve this truly trustless DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) status, which is the Holy Grail of blockchain, and why Schnoodle has experienced unprecedented success since launch.

## Utility Concepts

### DeFi Protocol

Schnoodle is a progressive DeFi token that uses a sophisticated automated wealth distribution system (inspired by [RFI](https://reflect.finance/)) known as Blockchain Automated Reward Kickbacks (BARK). This means that holders receive rewards constantly (without even farming) whenever any sell swap takes place on the network. This has been a tremendous success and garnered exceedingly bullish sentiment from the community that Schnoodle is unlike any other rewards-based coin.

### Benevolence

Schnoodle is also a coin with a conscience. A small percentage of all transactions are donated to a good cause agreed on by the community. This takes place automatically within the smart contract, and is known as the eleemosynary functionality.

### Yield Farming

Our sophisticated Moon Farming Platform (MFP) is like yield farming, but far more advanced. It completely breaks the mould of traditional yield farming, and differentiates us from other yield farming platforms with fully flexible opportunities for farmers. Read more about it here:

_Our SaaS solution for this is FaaS (Farming as a Service)._

### Multichain

Schnoodle's goal was always to be EVM-compatible chain agnostic. We have developed a system that allows it to be deployed by anyone on any EVM-compatible chain, and value will automatically be transferable between any two chains. This is known as PIMP (Polybridge Infinichain Meshnet Protocol), with FAB (Fully Autonomous Bridge) being the centralised part of this interoperability.

_Our SaaS solution for this is BaaS (Bridge as a Service)._

### NFT Platform

Our NFT platform is a unique concept that allows dynamic minting of fully-customisable 3D NFTs. We also want to issue NFTs that can also be farmed in our platform. There are other use cases we're considering such as an NFT metaverse that are earmarked for further triaging.

_Our SaaS solution for this is NaaS (NFT as a Service)._

### DAO Process

Ultimately, we intend Schnoodle to have further utility and for the direction of this to be determined by the community (as a DAO) with guidance from the team.
